libmus
=========


Go library to represent musical theory concepts in code.

The purpose is to provide a framework in order enable the creation of Pure Data plugins and then be able to develop an [Interactive Music Practice Textbook Framework](https://github.com/mniak/Pd/blob/master/README.md) focusing primarily in improving (my own) musical perception.
